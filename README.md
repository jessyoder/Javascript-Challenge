# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

I was given a data collection is too large to search through manually. The website's dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

I have been tasked with writing code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Users also need to filter the table data for specific values. 



### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* I created a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appended a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* I used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the columns to find rows that match user input, using these columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
